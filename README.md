# Super_Resolution

Abstract
Image Super-Resolution (SR) is a significant 
family of image processing algorithms used 
in computer vision to improve the resolution 
of pictures and videos.In recent years, deep 
learning techniques to image superresolution have advanced dramatically. The 
purpose of this article is to offer a detailed 
overview of current improvements in picture 
super-resolution utilizing deep learning 
algorithms. In general, extant studies on SR 
approaches may be divided into three broad 
categories: supervised SR, unsupervised SR, 
and domain-specific SR. We also discuss 
several other critical topics, such as publicly 
available benchmark datasets and 
performance evaluation measures. Finally, 
we end our study by outlining various 
prospective paths
